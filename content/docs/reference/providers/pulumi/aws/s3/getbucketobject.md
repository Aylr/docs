The S3 object data source allows access to the metadata and
_optionally_ (see below) content of an object stored inside S3 bucket.

> **Note:** The content of an object (`body` field) is available only for objects which have a human-readable `Content-Type` (`text/*` and `application/json`). This is to prevent printing unsafe characters and potentially downloading large amount of data which would be thrown away in favour of metadata.

> This content is derived from https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/blob/master/website/docs/d/s3_bucket_object.html.markdown.
