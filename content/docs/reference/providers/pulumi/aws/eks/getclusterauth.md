Get an authentication token to communicate with an EKS cluster.

Uses IAM credentials from the AWS provider to generate a temporary token that is compatible with
[AWS IAM Authenticator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator) authentication.
This can be used to authenticate to an EKS cluster or to a cluster that has the AWS IAM Authenticator
server configured.
