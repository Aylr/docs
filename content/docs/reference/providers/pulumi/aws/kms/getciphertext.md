The KMS ciphertext data source allows you to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
by using an AWS KMS customer master key. The value returned by this data source
changes every apply. For a stable ciphertext value, see the [`aws.kms.Ciphertext`
resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/kms_ciphertext.html).

> **Note:** All arguments including the plaintext be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
