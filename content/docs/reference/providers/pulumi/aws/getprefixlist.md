`aws..getPrefixList` provides details about a specific prefix list (PL)
in the current region.

This can be used both to validate a prefix list given in a variable
and to obtain the CIDR blocks (IP address ranges) for the associated
AWS service. The latter may be useful e.g. for adding network ACL
rules.
