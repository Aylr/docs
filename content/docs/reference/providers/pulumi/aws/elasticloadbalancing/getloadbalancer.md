Provides information about a "classic" Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
See [LB Data Source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/lb.html) if you are looking for "v2"
Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB).

This data source can prove useful when a module accepts an LB as an input
variable and needs to, for example, determine the security groups associated
with it, etc.
