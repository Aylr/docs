Pulumi's Cloud Native SDK makes it easy to target any Kubernetes environment to
provision a cluster, configure and deploy applications, and update them as
required.

Pulumi supports programming against Kubernetes---Minikube, on-premises and
cloud-hosted custom Kubernetes clusters, and the managed services from Google
(GKE), Azure (AKS), and Amazon (EKS). The Pulumi Kubernetes provider
packages and [CLI]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli" >}})
help you accomplish all these within minutes. Upon completing this guide you will have:

- Modify your program to deploy to MiniKube
